Advanced insight for audio sampling junkies.

This tool is based on data extracted with the pre-compiled Essentia
`streaming_extractor_music` extractor. Make sure you have a working copy
of the required build. A Dockerfile is also available but you will need
an executable wrapper to act as the native binary.
